## About this project

This is the repository of my thesis to obtain the title of higher technician in computer science.

This application is a prototype of an accounting system, it is not designed to work in production, it was intended only for researcher proporse.

So it is not the application that I would have liked to develop because I would have liked to add unit testing, a javascript frontend framework, and good coding practices, but the short time to deliver this didn't allow me to do that
